# Seasonal-Product-Discounter-2

## The Seasonal Product Discounter is an ongoing project. On every solo week we need to add new features to it, and improve existing ones.

## We need to unleash a multitude of queries against the Products Data, using the built-in query capabilities of the C# language, known as LINQ (Language Integrated Query).

### What are we going to learn?
### •	Create queries using LINQ.
### •	Use extension methods.
### •	Write parameterized unit tests.
